# hello-world
This is my first git hub repository.  All steps are doing based by git hub documentation beginners guide.

This is my first changes made using new branch of my hallo world project. They ask to write a little bit about myself. So, I am an undergraduate student at the Information Institute of Technology(IIT), Sri Lanka. My degree is about Software engineering(BEng). That's why I try to learn this amazing platform Git-hub.
